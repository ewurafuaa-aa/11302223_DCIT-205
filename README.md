I learnt about user research, information architecture, usability testing, and user-centered design principles, which helped me to create a website that is intuitive, easy to navigate, and provide a positive user experience.

Developing a website requires planning and organizing content effectively and during this project I learnt how to structure information for the website properly. I also learnt how to organize my code.

With the increasing use of mobile devices, creating a responsive website that adapts to different screen sizes is crucial and I learnt about responsive design techniques, media queries, and mobile-first approaches to ensure that my website looks and functions well across various devices.</p>
